* OpenCV 3.0.0 is required to compile our program
* In terminal
>   $ cd <the directory where nrdc.cpp exists>
>   $ make / make all
>   $ ./nrdc
* IMPORTANT
There are parameters that will have to be manipulated by hands sometimes in aggregate_match_patch.cpp,
and therefore we suggest you to try changing the parameter to get the best performance when using your own images.
The input file should be placed under ./image folder
reference image named ref.png
source image named src.png
The output file will be placed under ./image folder too
the name of the result image will be result.png
